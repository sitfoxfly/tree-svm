Tree-SVM: Tool for SVM optimization on tree data structures

-----------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:

Tree-SVM implements SMO decomposition algorithm from Fan et al JMLR 2005.

Tree-SVM supports only binary classification by now. 
Input trees must be encoded in the bracket notation, e.g., "(A (B (C) (D)) (E (F)))" represents the following tree:

     A
    / \
   B   E
  / \   \
 C   D   F 

where "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F" are corresponding node labels.

Example of input file:
+1 (beats (clarity (on (#CAMERA))) (out) (easily) (clarity (on (#CAMERA))))
-1 (#CAMERA (is (2.5 (same (as (that (on (#CAMERA))))) (wide))))

Avaliable kernels:
- Intersection kernel (counts the number of common labels for both input trees)
- Subtree kernel (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2001)
- Subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002)
- Partial tree kernel (Moschitti, 2006)
- Skip-node kernel 
- Linear Skip-node kernel
- Lookahead Skip-node kernel
